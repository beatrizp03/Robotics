# Robot Localization and Navigation Project

## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of robotics, focusing on **localization** and **navigation** techniques for mobile robots. Using the TurtleBot3 WafflePi as the platform, we implemented and evaluated algorithms that enable accurate pose estimation and effective path planning in complex environments.

### Objectives
- **Localization**: Develop methods to estimate the robot's pose using Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL).
- **Navigation**: Implement global and local planning algorithms, including Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), to navigate the robot to target destinations while avoiding obstacles.
