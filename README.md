# Robot Localization and Navigation Project

## Overview
This project explores the fundamentals of robotics, focusing on **localization** and **navigation** techniques for mobile robots. Using the TurtleBot3 WafflePi as the platform, we implemented and evaluated algorithms that enable accurate pose estimation and effective path planning in complex environments.

### Objectives
- **Localization**: Develop methods to estimate the robot's pose using Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL).
- **Navigation**: Implement global and local planning algorithms, including Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), to navigate the robot to target destinations while avoiding obstacles.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the complexities of mobile robot localization and navigation. It highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms and paved the way for further improvements in dynamic robotics applications.
